# Welcome to the Homepage for the WUSTL Political Science Department Speaker Series

About once per week, we host a speaker during the lunch hour (a buffet-style lunch is provided). You can find details on our scheduled talks below:

# September 14 -- Monika Nalepa (Chicago)

The Department Speaker Series will continue during the Fall semester and start with a talk by Monika Nalepa from the University of Chicago. With a focus on post-communist Europe, her research interests include transitional justice, parties and legislatures, and game-theoretic approaches to comparative politics. Her first book, *Skeletons in the Closet: Transitional Justice in Post-Communist Europe* was published in the Cambridge Studies in Comparative Politics Series and received the Best Book award from the Comparative Democratization section of the APSA and the Leon Epstein Outstanding Book Award from the Political Organizations and Parties section of the APSA. She has published her research in the Journal of Comparative Politics, World Politics, Journal of Conflict Resolution, Journal of Theoretical Politics, and Decyzje. Her next book manuscript, *Parties Ascendant*, examines the development of programmatic parties in new democracies with a special focus on legislative institutions.

As usual, the talk will take place in the Seigle Hall Conference Room (#248) on Thursday (September 14) from 12:00pm to 1:00pm, and we will provide a buffet style lunch.

The title of Monika's talk is "Purges, Truth Commissions, and Lustrations: The Long Term Consequences of Dealing with Authoritarian Legacies." Details are below:

   <p>
   The transitional justice literature treats lustration and administrative purges (such as de-communization, de-baathification and de-nazification) as the same type of mechanism for dealing with the past. Indeed, all of these institutions are forms of personnel transitional justice in that they aim at eliminating from the state apparatus members and collaborators of the previous authoritarian regime.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   This  chapter  draws  a  distinction  between  forms  of  transitional  justice  that  deal  with collaboration that was secret (lustration) and forms of collaboration that were known (such as purges).
   </p>
   
   <p>
   The  model  of  lustration  presented  in  the  previous  chapter  showed  how  lustration  enhances democratic representation by preventing blackmail of current politicians by former authoritarian elites. Lustration, by exposing the potentially embarrassing information about collaboration with the authoritarian regime’s enforcement apparatus, makes it impossible for former authoritarian elites to extort policies in exchange for keeping "skeletons in politicians' closet" secret.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   However, modeling the effect of the severity of purges leads to very different predictions for democratic representation. While the quality of political representation increases monotonically with the severity of lustration, thorough administrative purges may lead to worse effects for democratic representation than only partial leadership purges.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   A crucial theoretical result of this chapter is that democratic representation improves in direct proportion to the amount of lustration that is implemented, but does not improve in proportion to the intensity of purges.

# September 28 -- Emilie Hafner-Burton (UCSD)

The Department Speaker Series will continue with a talk by Emilie Hafner-Burton from the University of California, San Diego. WEmilie Hafner-Burton is the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of International Justice and Human Rights and co-director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation at the School. She is a leader in policy-relevant research on international law, studying when and why international laws work and don’t work. Hafner-Burton is author of "Making Human Rights a Reality" that looks at the emergence of a massive body of legal norms and procedures aimed at protecting human rights and why it has been so hard for these international laws to have much impact in parts of the world where human rights are most at risk. It was awarded the best book of 2015 by the International Studies Association. She has published widely on these and other research subjects, including social network analysis and international relations, economic sanctions and gender mainstreaming in international organizations.

As usual, the talk will take place in the Seigle Hall Conference Room (#248) on Thursday (September 28) from 12:00pm to 1:00pm, and we will provide a buffet style lunch.

The title of Emilie's talk is "Predictability versus Flexibility: Secrecy in International Investment Arbitration." Details are below:

<details> 
   <summary>  <font color="#005f85"> Abstract </font> </summary>
  
   <p>
   There is heated debate over the wisdom and effect of secrecy in international negotiations. This debate has become central to the process of foreign investment arbitration because parties to disputes nearly always can choose to hide arbitral outcomes from public view. Working with a new database of disputes at the world’s largest investor-state arbitral institution, the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, the authors examine the incentives of firms and governments to keep the details of their disputes secret.

# October 5 -- Byron D'Andra Orey (Jackson State)

The Department Speaker Series will continue with a talk by Byron D'Adra Orey from Jackson State. Byron’s research is in the area of race and politics, focusing heavily on racial attitudes and legislative behavior. Prior to coming to Jackson State, he previously taught at the University of Mississippi (1999-2001) and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln (2001-2008). In 2011, Dr. Orey was recognized by President Myers as Jackson State University’s Teacher of the Year and was nominated for the state-wide honor of Teacher of the Year. He also is the recipient of the 2011 Jewel Limar Prestage Mentorship Award and the 2008 Julia Cooper Teaching Award, both presented by the National Conference of Black Political Scientists. He has conducted lectures at St. Anne’s College at Oxford University (Oxford, England), Emory University, Winneba University in Ghana, Africa, Yale University and Spelman College, to name a few. In 2008 he received a National Science Foundation grant to create a Political Psychology laboratory at Jackson State University. In 2009, Dr. Orey won a nation-wide competition with TESS: Time Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences to examine the impact of such trusted sources as President Obama and former President Clinton on racial attitudes. He has published over twenty scholarly articles and book chapters and is currently working on two Book-Length Manuscripts: 1) Contemporary Racial Attitudes in Black and White; and 2) Strange Legislative Bedfellows: The Intersectionality of Race, Gender and Party in State Legislatures.

As usual, the talk will take place in the Seigle Hall Conference Room (#248) on Thursday (October 5) from 12:00pm to 1:00pm, and we will provide a buffet style lunch.

The title of Byron's talk is "Racially Traumatic Stressful Events and Symbols: African Americans' Responses to Police and the Confederate Flag." Details are below:

<details> 
   <summary>  <font color="#005f85"> Abstract </font> </summary>
  
   <p>
We conceptualize adverse interactions between police and the minority communities they sometimes serve as racially traumatic stressful events (RTSEs) and seek to measure public response to them. We implement two experimental studies, one on a white college campus and another with subjects recruited from a historically black campus in the deep south. We then measure galvanic skin levels while exposing the subjects to an array of photos, including photos of police conducting traffic stops. Our findings suggest the need for more research into the gender and racial differences in how individuals perceive such interactions. Further, we explore intra-racial differences in response among blacks, showing that attitudinal predispositions, in particular previous experiences with police brutality, violent encounters with law enforcement, linked fate, assessments of the public regard of blacks in society, and economic and legal disillusionment shape individual responses to police as well as to threatening images. The fact that mere photos of police conducting traffic stops generate responses similar in some groups to photos taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) threatening photo series should be taken as a sign that these are important problems in need of more study. The IAPS threat photos we used included an attacking dog, attacking snakes, and a man with a gun in his mouth, a masked man with a knife, and a street scene with shooting soldiers.
