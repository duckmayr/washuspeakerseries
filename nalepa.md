# September 14 -- Monika Nalepa (University of Chicago)

The Department Speaker Series will continue during the Fall semester and start with a talk by Monika Nalepa from the University of Chicago. With a focus on post-communist Europe, her research interests include transitional justice, parties and legislatures, and game-theoretic approaches to comparative politics. Her first book, Skeletons in the Closet: Transitional Justice in Post-Communist Europe was published in the Cambridge Studies in Comparative Politics Series and received the Best Book award from the Comparative Democratization section of the APSA and the Leon Epstein Outstanding Book Award from the Political Organizations and Parties section of the APSA. She has published her research in the Journal of Comparative Politics, World Politics, Journal of Conflict Resolution, Journal of Theoretical Politics, and Decyzje. Her next book manuscript, Parties Ascendant, examines the development of programmatic parties in new democracies with a special focus on legislative institutions.

As usual, the talk will take place in the Seigle Hall Conference Room (#248) on Thursday (September 14) from 12:00pm to 1:00pm, and we will provide a buffet style lunch.

The title of Monika's talk is "Purges, Truth Commissions, and Lustrations: The Long Term Consequences of Dealing with Authoritarian Legacies." Details are below:

   <p>
   The transitional justice literature treats lustration and administrative purges (such as de-communization, de-baathification and de-nazification) as the same type of mechanism for dealing with the past. Indeed, all of these institutions are forms of personnel transitional justice in that they aim at eliminating from the state apparatus members and collaborators of the previous authoritarian regime.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   This  chapter  draws  a  distinction  between  forms  of  transitional  justice  that  deal  with collaboration that was secret (lustration) and forms of collaboration that were known (such as purges).
   </p>
   
   <p>
   The  model  of  lustration  presented  in  the  previous  chapter  showed  how  lustration  enhances democratic representation by preventing blackmail of current politicians by former authoritarian elites. Lustration, by exposing the potentially embarrassing information about collaboration with the authoritarian regimeâ€™s enforcement apparatus, makes it impossible for former authoritarian elites to extort policies in exchange for keeping "skeletons in politicians' closet" secret.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   However, modeling the effect of the severity of purges leads to very different predictions for democratic representation. While the quality of political representation increases monotonically with the severity of lustration, thorough administrative purges may lead to worse effects for democratic representation than only partial leadership purges.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   A crucial theoretical result of this chapter is that democratic representation improves in direct proportion to the amount of lustration that is implemented, but does not improve in proportion to the intensity of purges.
