# September 28 -- Emilie Hafner-Burton (UCSD)

The Department Speaker Series will continue with a talk by Emilie Hafner-Burton from the University of California, San Diego. WEmilie Hafner-Burton is the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of International Justice and Human Rights and co-director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation at the School. She is a leader in policy-relevant research on international law, studying when and why international laws work and don’t work. Hafner-Burton is author of "Making Human Rights a Reality" that looks at the emergence of a massive body of legal norms and procedures aimed at protecting human rights and why it has been so hard for these international laws to have much impact in parts of the world where human rights are most at risk. It was awarded the best book of 2015 by the International Studies Association. She has published widely on these and other research subjects, including social network analysis and international relations, economic sanctions and gender mainstreaming in international organizations.

As usual, the talk will take place in the Seigle Hall Conference Room (#248) on Thursday (September 28) from 12:00pm to 1:00pm, and we will provide a buffet style lunch.

The title of Emilie's talk is "Predictability versus Flexibility: Secrecy in International Investment Arbitration." Details are below:

   <p>
   There is heated debate over the wisdom and effect of secrecy in international negotiations. This debate has become central to the process of foreign investment arbitration because parties to disputes nearly always can choose to hide arbitral outcomes from public view. Working with a new database of disputes at the world’s largest investor-state arbitral institution, the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, the authors examine the incentives of firms and governments to keep the details of their disputes secret.
